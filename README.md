# GatorShare

## Project Description:
GatorShare is a web application designed to help University of Florida students easily give and receive help for various tasks in a safe and secure environment. The application will require students to authenticate themselves using their UF email, while also maintaining their anonymity in order to maintain user confidentiality. In addition, we will incorporate incentives to motivate others to stay active and help others when they can. These incentives will cultivate the community and ensure that the people most contributing are recognized. GatorShare will connect students through their common challenges and help new students feel at home.
