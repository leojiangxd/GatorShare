# GatorShare

## Project Description:. 
GatorShare is a web application designed to foster a supportive and collaborative community among University of FLorida students. The platform allows students to easily offer and receive help with miscellaneous tasks in a safe and secure environment. To ensure security, users will be required to authenticate themselves through their UF email. This will remain confidential and is not visible to others, thus allowing students to maintain their anonymity.  In addition, we will incorporate incentives to motivate others to stay active and help others when they can. These incentives will cultivate the community and ensure that the people most contributing are recognized. GatorShare will connect students through their common challenges and help new students feel at home.
