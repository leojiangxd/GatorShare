# Sprint 1

## User Stories
- We identified 15 key issues to address in the project, primarily focusing on design and user requirements.
- Additional user stories may be added as the project scope evolves.

## Planned Issues
- For Sprint 1, we aimed to complete 8 critical issues:
  - User Authentication & Management: Login, registration, logout, profile updates, and user deletion.
  - Core Features: Feed, comments, and posts.

## Progress & Completed Issues
- The frontend team initialized the React application and installed the necessary libraries and dependencies, including Tailwind CSS.
- The UI for all 8 planned issues has been successfully designed.

## Incomplete Issues
- The frontend team prioritized defining the websiteâ€™s overall look before committing to full implementation.
  - While the UI is mostly complete, more work still needs to be done to integrate backend functionality and the current UI is subject to change.
